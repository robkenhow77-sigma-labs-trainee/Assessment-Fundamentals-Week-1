# Level 2

## Setup

Copy and paste your code from Level 1 into the space provided in `task_two.py`.

## Instructions

Next, change your program so that it will keep a count of the same items instead of adding them to the basket as separate items.

Items with the same name but different price should be counted as different items.

The receipt should then be printed like this

```
Bread x 2 - £3.60
Milk x 1 - £0.80
Butter x 1 - £1.20
Total: £5.60
```
